TODO

index
welcome people to the app
link to pages for each user
also sign up for your own page


user pages
map
if logged in, let them edit their own


if logged in, default page shouldn't ask them to register
should instead allow them to edit their map
and also tell them about other people's maps

make a map view/thing -- maybe {}/profile/map?
test out binding JSON to topojson
figure out how to edit and then PUT

---

add tooltips to charts (why is this so hard?)
add not-editable map
figure out why it takes so long to load
faster way to join JSON?
if signed in, hide "Won't you please sign in or register?" and show "Edit your map here"
